/**
 * What the way in says when something goes wrong, and where a site rewrites it.
 *
 * Every one of these sentences was written where it was printed: four in
 * templates/login.php, six in templates/register.php, two on the second-step
 * screen, one where a new password is chosen. Thirteen sentences that a person
 * only ever reads on the worst day they have with this site, and the only way
 * to change any of them was to copy the template into a theme — which is to
 * say: to stop receiving every other improvement to that screen for ever.
 *
 * The one that started this is the social one. "We could not finish signing
 * you in with that provider" is true and useless: the site knows whether it
 * runs one network or six, whether there is a help desk to write to, whether
 * the person should be trying the other button instead. The plugin cannot
 * know any of that, and the site cannot say it.
 *
 * So the sentences live here, all thirteen in the same shape, and they are
 * rewritten the same way the e-mails are — which is deliberate, and is why
 * this reads like mail-templates.php. Three rules, the same three:
 *
 * The plugin's own words are the starting point, in the language the site
 * runs in. Nothing is copied into the database on install, the boxes are never
 * blank, and a site that changes nothing goes on receiving better wording with
 * every update.
 *
 * A rewrite belongs to a language and not to a site. A site running in two
 * languages does not show the same sentence to both, so the key is the locale
 * and a language nobody touched keeps the plugin's own.
 *
 * Saving the plugin's own text unchanged is not a rewrite. Whoever opens the
 * tab, reads a sentence and presses save has said nothing, and recording it
 * would quietly freeze that site on today's wording.
 *
 * The locale helpers are the ones mail-templates.php already has. A locale key
 * is a locale key — the same regex, the same fallback, the same list of
 * languages a site can actually run in — and a second copy of it here would be
 * a second copy to keep in step the first time WordPress grows a locale shape
 * nobody expected.
 *
