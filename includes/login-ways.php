/**
 * The ways into this site, registered instead of written down.
 *
 * The sign-in template used to stack them in an order somebody typed: the
 * passkey, then the networks, then the e-mail form, then username and
 * password, with a divider between each pair. Two things were wrong with
 * that, and the second is the reason for this file.
 *
 * The first is height. Nobody decided the screen would be that tall — it is
 * what four blocks in a column add up to — and on a laptop the last way in
 * was below the fold of the one page that exists to be understood in a look.
 *
 * The second is that the template had to know about every way in there is.
 * Passkeys were an `if` in it; the networks were another; an add-on with a way
 * of its own had no way of getting drawn except by replacing the file. Now
 * each one registers itself the way a panel of the dashboard does — an id, a
 * label, a neutral icon and something that draws it — and the template asks
 * what there is. That registry is the seam: `Users+ Pro` adds its way in from
 * its own file, in the site's own order, without touching the template.
 *
 * Two arrangements come out of the same registry. Stacked is what there was,
 * and it is right while there are two ways in: tabs over two doors are more
 * friction than the doors. Tabs are what fixes the height from three ways up.
 * The site can force either, and by default the plugin counts.
