/**
 * The admin's design system: where its colours come from, and its pieces.
 *
 * Every screen in here used to be a `form-table` with a grey paragraph under
 * each control. That is not a style, it is the absence of one: the title of
 * an option, the sentence explaining it and the title of the next option all
 * weigh the same, so nothing leads the eye and two options read as one. The
 * complaint was that it is not nice to look at. The cause was that nothing
 * had a rank.
 *
 * So: tokens, and pieces built out of them. Two rules govern both.
 *
 * The first is where the colour comes from. WordPress lets a person pick an
 * admin colour scheme — nine of them — and a plugin that paints itself blue
 * on somebody's midnight dashboard looks like a plugin that was pasted in.
 * The scheme is published (`$_wp_admin_css_colors`), so it is read and the
 * plugin follows it. A site that would rather fix its own says so through the
 * filter below, and nothing else changes.
 *
 * The second is restraint. Nothing here invents a second interface: the
 * screens keep WordPress's structure, its tabs, its buttons and its tables.
 * What is added is rank — a title that reads as a title, an option that reads
 * as one thing, and a state you can see without reading.
 *
 * There is a third rule now, and it is the one that took longest to admit.
 * Every piece a screen needs lives here. A screen that reaches for
 * `form-table` because this file has no number-with-a-word-after-it is a
 * screen that has started a second design system, and the admin ended up with
 * four of them: the label in the left column on one tab, the title above the
 * control on the next, and the same question asked in two shapes two clicks
 * apart. So when something is missing it is added here, once, and every screen
 * gets it — rather than each screen solving it again in its own file with its
 * own markup. Nothing below is drawn with a two-column table, and no screen
 * writes CSS of its own.
 *
 * And a fourth, which is the correction the third one needed. There is no one
 * width. The measure — where a line of prose and a column of options stop —
 * was being applied to the screen itself, so a grid of providers, an editor
 * with a list beside it and a table of rows were all squeezed into a width
 * chosen for reading, while the rest of the window sat empty beside them. The
 * measure belongs to what is read: the pieces below carry it themselves.
 * `diluxone_users_ui_wide_open()` is for the shapes that have columns of their
 * own, and `diluxone_users_ui_aside_open()` puts the room that was left over
 * to work as a rail. The two are not alternatives — a screen that is a table
 * still has things to say about itself, and the rail is where they go.
 *
 * Two pieces of the system live next door in `admin-state.php`, because what
 * they draw is a state and that file is where the four states and their words
 * are: `diluxone_users_summary_table()`, the strip a screen opens with, and
 * `diluxone_users_not_now()`, a control that does not apply yet with the
 * reason above it. The second one is the one exception to "what is said goes
 * in the rail": it is not about the screen, it is about the box under it, and
 * three inches away in the other column it would be about nothing.

/**
 * A screen with a rail down its right-hand side.
 *
 * The measure — how wide a column of settings gets — was applied to the whole
 * screen, and that was two decisions wearing one number. A column of options
 * is read, so it stops at the measure; the screen is not read, it is the room
 * the column stands in, and on a wide window there were seven hundred pixels
 * of nothing to the right of everything. That is not spare room. It is the
 * column the screen was missing: the state of the thing being configured, the
 * sentence explaining it, the caveat that used to sit above the title where it
 * reads as news, and the way to whatever is related. Beside the settings all
 * of that is context; above and below them it is interruption.
 *
 * It is not a second two-column mechanism. A panel that declares a `preview`
 * already gets one from `diluxone_users_screen_panels()` — settings on the
 * left, what they do on the right — and a screen with two of those would have
 * two right-hand columns disagreeing about which is the right-hand column. So
 * this is that same component, with the other kind of second column in it, and
 * the rule is the obvious one: a panel has a preview or a rail, never both.
 *
 * What goes in the rail is handed to the closing call as a callable, rather
 * than being a third pair of open-and-close of its own, so a screen with
 * nothing to say beside itself draws no empty column: it is run into a buffer
 * and the column exists only if something came out of it. That
 * matters because most of what goes in a rail is conditional — a warning about
 * how this site is set up, a provider that is not configured yet — and a
 * bordered box with nothing in it is the thing this design system spent a whole
 * round taking off these screens.
 *
 * The settings themselves stay flat between the two calls: whatever a screen
 * prints after this goes in the main column, exactly as it did before.
 *
 * What goes in it has a shape, and it is always the same three parts in the
 * same order, because a rail that is a different thing on every tab is one
 * more thing to read rather than the answer to a question:
 *
 *   1. How this site stands today — `diluxone_users_ui_aside_state()`. Not
 *      what the tab can be set to: what it *is* set to, right now, in one
 *      sentence, with the pill that says whether that is good news.
 *   2. What the tab is for — `diluxone_users_ui_note()`, two or three lines.
 *      What it decides, and what it does not.
 *   3. Where the rest of it lives — `diluxone_users_ui_links()`.
 *
 * The first one is the part that was missing and the part that matters: the
 * rail reports on this site. It does not repeat the manual, and a sentence
 * that would read the same on a site that has never been configured belongs
 * in part two, where it is honest about being general.

 * with nothing beside it saying what it was a pill about. Worse, most of what
 * they said was the manual — what the tab can be set to, which is the same
 * paragraph on a site where nothing has been configured and on one that has

 * to, how many of them are there. One sentence in the present tense about
 * this site, and the pill that says whether that is good news. If the sentence
 * would read the same on every site that installs the plugin, it is not a
 * state — it is what the tab is for, and that is the note underneath.
 *
 * It goes first in the rail and nothing enforces that, because the rail is

 * @param string $state How that is doing, as `diluxone_users_state_pill()`

 * wrong — and both of them built it out of `du-field`, `du-section` and the
 * indent, with a comment admitting the design system had no piece for it. Two
 * copies of a shape is how the two of them start drifting: one says "the box",

 * and a year later they are different screens that happen to look alike.
 *

 * be a thing you can ask for — emptying the boxes says "say nothing", which is
 * not the same wish.

 * opening it: whether what goes out is the plugin's or this site's, and in
 * which language this site wrote it. It is said here rather than by the two
 * callers so that it cannot be said two ways.
 *

 * label cell is one of the ghost boxes on that screen.
 *
 * Here it is what it is: a small title and what it says.
 *
 * The body takes a list as readily as a sentence, and that is not a
 * convenience. It used to be one paragraph and nothing else, so a screen with

 * pretending to be a paragraph, reads as one block at any size, and cannot
 * hold a list at all without inventing markup that is not allowed inside a
 * `<p>`. Hand it lines and it writes the paragraphs.
 *
 * It takes a state as well, and that is what a rail is mostly made of. "Is
 * this on?" was being answered by a four-column summary table with one row in
 * it, which is a table drawn for the sake of a pill; beside the settings there
 * is no room for four columns and no need for them either. A title, the pill,

 * said.
