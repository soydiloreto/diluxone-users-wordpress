/**
 * Single-use link sign-in ("magic link").
 *
 * Signing in and registering can be the same step: the person types their
 * e-mail, receives a link and gets in with it. If the account did not exist,
 * it is created right there.
 *
 * How it works:
 *   1. A random token is generated.
 *   2. Only its hash is stored in the database, never the token: if somebody
 *      walks off with the database, they cannot get in with what is there.
 *   3. On opening the link it is validated, the session starts and the token
 *      is deleted — it works exactly once.
 *
 * Decisions that matter:
 *   - The answer is identical whether the account exists or not. Saying "we
 *     could not find that e-mail" turns the form into a detector of who is
 *     registered.
 *   - Constant-time comparison, so the token does not leak through how long
 *     it takes to fail.
 *   - A per-e-mail request limit, so it cannot be used as a battering ram or
 *     as a machine for mailing third parties.
 *
 * This lives alongside WordPress's ordinary registration: it is one more
 * door, not a replacement. The "e-mail only" setting is what closes the others.
