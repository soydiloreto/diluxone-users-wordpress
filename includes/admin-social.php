/**
 * The social-login screen: the networks, the rules, and each one's detail.
 *
 * Twelve networks are a set to be looked over, not a list to be read down.
 * They were a grid of cards and became a strip of twelve rows, and that put
 * the whole set into one narrow column with half a window empty beside it:
 * finding one network meant reading the eleven above it. A card in a grid is
 * found by where it is; a row is found by reading.
 *
 * So the grid is back, and it is the grid this admin already has rather than
 * the one that used to be here: the same card the home screen is built out
 * of, taking all the width WordPress gives, because a set of twelve things is
 * what `diluxone_users_ui_wide_open()` is for. What the old grid had and this
 * one does not is twelve brand colours shouting at once — those stay where
 * they earn their keep, on the buttons people meet on the sign-in page, and
 * here a network is told apart by its logo.
 *
 * The rules and each provider's own screen are settings with something to
 * say beside them, so they are the other shape: a column of options at the
 * measure and a rail of explanation in the room it leaves over.
