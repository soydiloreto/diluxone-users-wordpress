 *
 *   - A feature that is not installed leaves no gap. Its file is not there,
 *     so it never registered, so the tab does not exist — rather than a tab
 *     that exists and apologises.
 *   - Anything can add one from outside: an add-on, a site's own plugin, a
 *     theme. The registry is the seam, and it is the same call the plugin
 *     uses for its own.
