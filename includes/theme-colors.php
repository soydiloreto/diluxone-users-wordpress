 * hand. That is a stylesheet a site has to maintain, and it is the first
 * thing that goes stale.
 *
 * Themes already publish their palette: `theme.json` declares it and
 * WordPress hands it over through wp_get_global_settings(). So the plugin can
 * ask. Which colour of that palette plays which part is the one thing nobody
 * can know for certain — `primary` means the brand in most themes and
 * something else in some — so it is guessed where the slug says so and asked
 * where it does not, on a screen that shows the palette it found.
 *
 * Several themes, Astra among them, publish values that are themselves custom
 * properties: `var(--ast-global-color-0)`. Those are kept as they are rather
 * than resolved, and that is the better answer — the plugin then follows the
 * theme live, including whatever the theme does in dark mode.
