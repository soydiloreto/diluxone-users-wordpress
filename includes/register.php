 *
 * It does not always fit. A site that asks for more than an address before
 * letting somebody in — a name, a country, whatever the fields say is
 * required — needs a form that asks for those things, and a page to put it
 * on. A site where somebody is approved before they get in needs a moment
 * between "I want an account" and "here is your link". Both of those need a
 * registration that is a step of its own, which is what this is.
 *
 * The address is still the identity and there is still no password: what
 * arrives after this form is the same sign-in link as always.
