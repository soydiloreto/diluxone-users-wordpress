 * simply never fills — which is what makes it safe for a feature nobody asked
 * for to sit in the middle of the sign-in.
 *
 * It also listens rather than being called for a second reason, less elegant
 * and more important: the parts that would otherwise have to report — the
 * passkeys, the second step, the account area — belong to other subjects, and
 * a log that needs a line added to twelve files is a log that goes quiet the
 * next time one of them is rewritten. Every hook below is either WordPress's
 * own or one this plugin already fired for something else.

 * that answers the question these events need answering: what was it BEFORE.
