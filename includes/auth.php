 * top, and it can ask for a second factor on all of them, on some, or on
 * none. Those combinations cannot be resolved with a chain of `if`s: what is
 * needed is one place where they are enumerated and a single path everybody
 * goes through.

 * That path is `diluxone_users_complete_login()`. However they get in —
 * password, link, social network — everyone ends up there, and there it is
 * decided whether the session opens or whether something else has to be
 * proved first. Without it, adding a second factor would mean remembering to
 * add it at every door, and the one that gets forgotten stays open.
