/**
 * What happened on this site, written down.
 *
 * Everything else in this plugin knows what is true right now: who has a
 * session open, which networks are linked, whether the second step is on. None
 * of it knows what happened yesterday. "Somebody changed my e-mail address and
 * I did not" is a question about the past, and until now the honest answer was
 * that the site did not keep one.
 *
 * So there is a table, and the site decides what goes in it. Three decisions
 * shaped the whole file and none of them is an accident:
 *
 *   - A table of its own, not the options and not the user meta. This grows
 *     without limit by nature, and anything autoloaded that grows without
 *     limit is a site that gets slower every day for a reason nobody finds.
 *   - Out of the box it records the way in and the way out, and nothing else.
 *     A plugin that starts writing a row for every change a person makes to
 *     their profile has made a decision about somebody's disk and about
 *     somebody's privacy that was not its to make. The rest is ticked by hand,
 *     by whoever will be paying for the rows.
 *   - The screen says how big it is, in rows and in bytes, read from the
 *     database. "This may grow" is a sentence anybody can ignore; "1.284.902
 *     rows, 412 MB" is not.
 *
 * The purge is the other half of that bargain. A log with no end is a disk
 * that fills up, so the site says how long it keeps one and a daily event
 * drops what is older. Set to zero it keeps everything, which is a real answer
 * for a site that has to, and the screen says what that costs.
 *
 * ── About the annotations ──
 *
 * This file is the table: every query in it goes to the plugin's own table, by
 * a name built here out of `$wpdb->prefix` and a literal, and there is no
 * caching layer in front of it because a log is written once and read from an
 * admin screen that is asking what is true this second. PHPCS cannot follow a
 * table name that arrives in a variable, so it is told once, up here, rather
 * than on thirty lines — a `phpcs:enable` further down would stop applying at
 * the first `return` PHPCS reads, not at the first one that runs, and leave
 * everything after it uncovered.
 *
 * wordpress.org's own checker asks the same question through a sniff of its
 * own, and it is told the same thing in the same place. It reads a table name
 * as a parameter whether it arrives in a variable or is written out at the
 * query, so there is no arrangement of this code that answers it — only the
 * fact that the name is `$wpdb->prefix` and a literal, which is what the
 * annotation says.
