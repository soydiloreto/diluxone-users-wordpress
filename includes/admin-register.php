 * Who gets an account, and how. A tab of the Access screen.

 * registration changes nothing about signing in. True and beside the point:
 * they are asked at the same moment and they share half their settings. So
 * it is the third tab of the door, after where people sign in and with what.
 *
 * The question is asked in two steps, because that is how it is thought
 * about. First: does this site let people in at all, or does an administrator
 * make every account? Then, and only then: through which doors — the e-mail
 * link can create the account, a social account can, the site's own form can,
 * WordPress's own form can, and none of them excludes another. Four tick
 * boxes on their own could not say the first thing: a site with all four shut
 * and a site that has decided nobody registers look identical, and the second
 * is a decision while the first is a state somebody arrived at.
 *
 * There is no switch behind that first answer. It is read off the doors —
 * open is "at least one of them is" — because a switch of its own would be a
 * second thing to say the same thing, and the day the two disagree the site
 * behaves like one of them and shows the other.
