 * person can ask not to be told was only visible from their own account area.
 * Three different places for one question — what does this site send, and who
 * decides.
 *
 * The answer has two halves. The site decides the rule for each notice; where
 * the rule leaves a switch, the person sets it from their own account area.
 * The first tab shows the whole picture, the second is where the rules are
 * written, and the third is the wording of every e-mail the plugin sends —
 * including the two nobody can refuse, which is where that tab started and why
 * it used to hold one of them.
 *
 * Its tabs are registered like every other screen's, so a feature that sends
 * its own mail brings its own tab with it.
