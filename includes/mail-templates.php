<?php
/**
 * The words of every e-mail this plugin sends, and where a site rewrites them.
 *
 * Until now each message was written where it was sent: the sign-in link in
 * login.php, the second-step code in auth-email.php, the two notices in
 * notify.php. That is fine for sending and hopeless for changing — the one
 * message a site could rewrite was the sign-in link, it had a tab of its own,
 * and the other three could only be got at from code through a filter.
 *
 * So the texts live here, all four in the same shape, and the sending keeps
 * happening where it happened: each message is composed through
 * `diluxone_users_mail_compose()` and the filters that were already on the way
 * out are still applied afterwards, so nothing that hooked them breaks.
 *
 * Three rules make the thing worth having.
 *
 * The first is that the plugin's own text is the starting point, in the
 * language the site runs in. It is not copied into the database on install and
 * it is not a blank box waiting to be filled: it is what `__()` returns, so
 * changing the site's language changes every e-mail without anybody editing
 * anything, and an update of the plugin that improves a sentence improves it
 * on every site that did not rewrite it.
 *
 * The second is that a rewrite belongs to a language and not to the site. A
 * site running in two languages does not send the same body to both, and a
 * store keyed by nothing but the message would force it to. So the key is the
 * locale, and a language nobody touched keeps using what the plugin ships.
 *
 * The third is that saving the plugin's own text unchanged is not a rewrite.
 * Whoever opens a message, reads it and presses save has said nothing, and
 * recording it as a rewrite would quietly freeze that site on today's wording
 * for ever. What is compared is what is in the boxes against what the plugin
 * would have said; equal means there is nothing to store.
 *
 * @package DiluxOneUsers

/**
 * Where the rewritten texts are kept.
 *
 * Not one of `diluxone_users_option_defaults()`: the value is a map of
 * locales, and what saves those settings sanitises every key with
 * `sanitize_key()`, which lowercases — `es_AR` would come back out as `es_ar`
 * and never match the locale it was written for. It is read and written here,
 * with the sanitising a map of locales actually needs.

 * plugin's own words for whichever language is being written, which means
 * calling `__()` after switching. A closure is called then; a string was
 * translated when the array was built.
 *
 * `required` is the placeholder a message cannot be sent without. A sign-in
 * e-mail with no link is not a shorter e-mail, it is a dead end, so a rewrite
 * that lost it is refused when it is saved and ignored when it is sent.
