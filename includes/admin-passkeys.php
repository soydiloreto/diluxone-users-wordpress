 * The passkeys screen.

 * plugin notices — no screen loses a tab it had written down, because no
 * screen had it written down.
 *
 * Whether passkeys are offered at all is NOT decided here. That box lives on
 * Access › Ways in, beside the e-mail link and the password, because what it
 * answers is "what can somebody sign in with" and that question is asked once,
 * in one place. What is left here is how they behave once they are offered —
 * the same split as everywhere else: turning a thing on lives with the other
 * things that can be turned on, setting it up lives with the thing itself.
