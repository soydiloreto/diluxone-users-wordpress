/**
 * Does this site send e-mail?
 *
 * The question looks silly and it is the most important one in the plugin:
 * the sign-in link, the second-factor code and the confirmation for deleting
 * an account are all e-mails. If they do not go out, the site has no way in
 * and nobody finds out until somebody cannot get in.
 *
 * The temptation is to ask `has_filter('phpmailer_init')`: if somebody hooked
 * there, a server is configured. That is a lie — a mail plugin that is active
 * but badly configured hooks all the same — and it is exactly the mistake
 * that made this screen say "ready" while nothing was going out.
 *
 * So nothing is guessed: what really happened the last time WordPress tried
 * to send something is recorded, and a button is offered to test it.
