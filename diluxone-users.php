 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this exists
 *
 * Who a person is, how they get in and how long their session lasts is the
 * same problem on every site, and until now it was solved again on each one.
 * Here it lives once.
 *
 * What it covers: the details you ask a person for, the account area on the
 * front end, how they sign in — e-mail link, password, social accounts,
 * passkeys —, the second factor, their sessions and their data.
 *
 * What it does not cover yet: paid subscriptions. That drags in a payment
 * gateway, recurring billing, retries and invoicing, and it will arrive as a
 * separate add-on (`diluxone-users-subscriptions`) so that a free site does
 * not carry billing code it never runs. The `diluxone_users_` prefix is
 * already the family's, so metadata keys will not move when it lands.

 * boot, that would be coupling to resolve with a hook, not with load order.
 *
 * Translations are loaded by WordPress itself. Since 4.6 it resolves a plugin
 * text domain just in time, from WP_LANG_DIR/plugins/ first and from the
 * Domain Path above after that, so calling load_plugin_textdomain() here would
 * only duplicate work WordPress already does.
