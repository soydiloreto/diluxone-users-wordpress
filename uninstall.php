/**
 * What is left behind when the plugin is deleted.
 *
 * By default: everything. The settings, the activity log and — above all —
 * what is in people's profiles. Most of what this plugin wrote is not the
 * plugin's: it is somebody's name, their phone number, their date of birth,
 * the passkey they sign in with and the second factor standing between their
 * account and whoever wants it. A plugin deleted by accident, or deleted in
 * order to be installed again, must not be the thing that loses them.
 *
 * So the wiping is a decision somebody makes beforehand, on
 * DiluxOne Users+ → Maintenance → Tools, and it is off until they do. Once
 * ticked, this file runs on delete — not on deactivate — and takes it all:
 * the table, the settings, and every meta key the plugin ever wrote,
 * including the answers to the fields the site invented.
 *
 * On a network it runs once per site, because that is where the data is: the
 * settings are per site, the log table is per site, and only the user meta is
 * shared — which is why the meta is deleted on the last pass and not on each.
