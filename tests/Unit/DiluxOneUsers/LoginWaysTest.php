 * Two decisions the browser suite cannot reach.
 *
 * The end-to-end specs always say which arrangement they want, because a test
 * that measured the height of "whatever the plugin decided" would be
 * measuring two things at once. So the rule that decides it when nobody says
 * — stacked up to two ways in, tabs from three — is only ever exercised on a
 * real site, by the site that never touched the setting. That is the
 * commonest site there is and it had no test at all.
 *
 * The other is the order, and it is here rather than in the browser for a
 * different reason: what is worth pinning is not that a saved order is drawn,
 * which the browser proves, but what happens to a way in that is NOT in the
 * saved order — the one an add-on registered this morning, against an order
 * the site saved last year. It has to appear. A registry where installing
 * something makes it invisible is not a seam, and the failure would be silent
 * on every screen.
