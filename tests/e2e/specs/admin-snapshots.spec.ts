/**
 * A picture of every screen, compared with the picture from last time.
 *
 * The measurements next door know the rules a layout must not break. They do
 * not know what the screens are supposed to look like, and they never will: a
 * line nobody asked for, a heading two sizes too big, a card whose ground went
 * grey, a preview that stopped matching the page it claims to preview — every
 * one of those keeps every rule and is still wrong. The only thing that
 * catches them is the picture, and the only thing that makes a picture an
 * assertion is having yesterday's to compare it with.
 *
 * Three things keep that from becoming a suite that cries wolf, and all three
 * are decisions rather than settings:
 *
 *   1. What is photographed is the plugin's own block, not the window. The
 *      admin bar counts how long the page took to build and says so; the menu
 *      carries update badges; the footer prints the WordPress version. None
 *      of that is this plugin's and all of it changes on its own.
 *   2. What moves by itself inside that block is masked — the dates and the
 *      counts in the reports, the environment table, an avatar.
 *   3. The window, the pixel ratio, the motion and the caret are all pinned,
 *      in the `visual` project in playwright.config.ts.
 *
 * A baseline is a picture of one machine's font rendering, which is why this
 * project is opt-in (`make test-visual`) rather than part of the run CI does.
 * When a change to a screen IS the change you wanted, `make test-visual-update`
 * writes the new pictures and the diff in the commit is the review.

/**
 * What is painted over before the picture is taken.
 *
 * A mask keeps the element's box and fills it, so a block that changes SIZE
 * still shows up as a difference — which is the point. It is only the content
 * that is being forgiven, never the geometry. Selectors that match nothing on
 * a given screen cost nothing.
