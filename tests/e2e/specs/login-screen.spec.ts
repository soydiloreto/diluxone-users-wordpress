/**
 * The screen people actually meet, measured and read.
 *
 * Two things this suite could not see before. The first is geometry: the
 * split layout stretched its blue panel to whatever height the form happened
 * to be, so on a laptop the one sentence the page came to say sat halfway
 * down a column twice the height of the window — below the fold, on a screen
 * that is nothing but that sentence and a form. Three suites were green while
 * that shipped, because none of them can see a page.
 *
 * The second is the wording. Every message the way in shows is now the site's
 * to rewrite, and a mechanism nobody proves end to end is a settings screen
 * that writes to a table. So the last two tests take the long way round:
 * type a sentence into the dashboard, press save, then fail a real sign-in
 * with a social network and read what a stranger is told.
 *
 * The widths are the ones the complaint came from — "monitores chicos que son
 * relativamente grandes". 1366×768 is the commonest laptop there is and 1280×720
 * the floor under it.
