/**
 * The thirteen pictures the wordpress.org listing shows.
 *
 * Not the same thing as `admin-snapshots.spec.ts`, and the difference is the
 * whole reason this file exists. Those pictures are assertions: they are
 * compared with yesterday's and the test fails when a screen changed. These
 * are not compared with anything — they are written, and what they are for is
 * somebody deciding whether to install the plugin.
 *
 * They were being taken by hand, which is why they went stale: the admin was
 * redesigned, "Status" became "Maintenance", Reports appeared, and the
 * listing went on showing screens that no longer existed. A picture taken by
 * hand is a picture nobody retakes. So this is a spec, it runs against the
 * same seeded site as the rest of the suite, and re-taking all thirteen is
 * one command.
 *
 * The numbering and the order are the readme's: `screenshot-N.png` matches
 * the Nth line under `== Screenshots ==`, and a picture that moves without
 * its caption moving is a listing that lies. The caption of each one is
 * copied into the test name, so `npx playwright test listing` prints the
 * readme back and the two can be read side by side.
 *
 * Opt-in (`make screenshots`) and its own Playwright project, for the same
 * reason the visual one is: a fixed window, no motion, and a machine whose
 * fonts these are.
