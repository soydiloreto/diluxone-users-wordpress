/**

 *
 * The complaint this suite comes from was one sentence — "no entra todo, hay
 * mucho scroll" — and it was true on a laptop with all four ways in switched
 * on, because the screen stacked them and nobody had decided it would. So the
 * first test is a measurement and not a look: with the four doors and the tabs
 * the page fits the window, and with the same four stacked it does not. Both
 * halves are asserted. A "it fits" that would also pass on the broken
 * arrangement proves nothing at all, and the second assertion is what stops
 * this one quietly becoming that.
 *
 * Everything is found by an id, a class or a data attribute. The site runs in
 * Spanish and the plugin ships eight locales: a locator that reads "Password"
 * is a locator that passes here and fails on the next machine.
