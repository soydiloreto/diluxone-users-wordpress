/**
 * The Summary of the Security screen, and whether it tells the truth.
 *
 * A summary is the one screen that can be wrong without looking wrong: it
 * draws no control, so nothing about it can fail to save, and a row that
 * quotes a default instead of the setting reads exactly like a row that
 * quotes the setting. That is the whole subject here — not that the table
 * exists, but that what it says changes when the site changes.
 *
 * So each of these moves a setting and then goes and reads the summary. Half
 * of them move it the way the plugin's own API does, which is the fastest way
 * to put the site in an awkward state; the other half move it the way a
 * person does, by pressing Save on the tab beside it, which is the half that
 * would catch a summary reading a different option from the one the form
 * writes.
 *
 * Not a word on this page is read. The site under test runs in Spanish and
 * the plugin ships eight locales, so a row is found by the address of the tab
 * it links to — the plugin's own slugs, which do not translate — and its
 * state is read from the class on the pill.

/**
 * Security › Two-step verification, and the one line on it that was misread.
 *
 * The rail beside those settings carries a pill about the second step asked
 * of somebody who arrives by an e-mail link. It used to be titled after the
 * arrival rather than after the question, so a site with the link switched on
 * and no second step to ask showed "the link — Off", and it was read the only
 * way it could be read: that the link itself had been turned off. The door is
 * not decided on this screen at all; it is decided on Access › Ways in.
 *
 * So what is asserted here is that the two screens cannot contradict each
 * other: the pill moves when the second step moves and stays put when the
 * door moves, which is the difference between reporting on the question and
 * reporting on the link.
 *
 * Nothing is read as a sentence. The state comes off the class, and the two
 * places where a word IS compared compare it with another word taken from the
 * running site — never with one written here, which would be English on a
 * site that runs in Spanish.
