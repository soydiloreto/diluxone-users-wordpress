/**
 * The activity log, end to end: tick a group, do the thing, see the row.
 *
 * It is the one question neither of the other two suites can answer. The unit
 * suite knows whether the policy says yes; the integration suite knows whether
 * a row written by hand comes back out of the table. Neither of them has ever
 * pressed Save on the settings tab, and neither has ever signed in — so
 * neither would notice a tick box whose name does not match what the save
 * reads, a save that writes the option and a report that reads another one, or
 * a listener hooked to something that no longer fires on a real sign-in. Every
 * one of those is a log that is quietly empty on a real site while all three
 * suites are green.
 *
 * So this one does the whole loop through the browser: the switch is thrown on
 * the screen a person throws it on, the sign-in is a real password on the real
 * form, and the row is read off the real report.
 *
 * Every hold here is an id, a class or a data attribute. The site runs in
 * Spanish and the plugin ships eight locales, so not one assertion reads a
 * sentence.
