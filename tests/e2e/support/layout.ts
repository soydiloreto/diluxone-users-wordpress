/**
 * The fourth suite: what a screen looks like, asked of the browser.
 *
 * The other three ask whether the code behaves. They answer that well, and
 * every visual bug this plugin has shipped got past all three of them green:
 * a block drawn on top of the card above it, half a screen of nothing beside
 * a column of settings, a bordered box with nothing inside it, a rail that
 * fell underneath the form it belongs beside. None of those is a wrong value
 * or a missing hook. They are geometry, and only a browser can see geometry.
 *
 * So this measures it. Not "does it look nice" — no test can hold an opinion,
 * and one that tried would be a test that fails whenever the design improves.
 * These are the four or five things that are never right by accident and
 * never wrong on purpose:
 *
 *   overlap   two blocks that are side by side in the markup, sharing pixels
 *   overflow  something reaching past the right-hand edge of the screen
 *   air       two blocks of a screen touching, with no space between them
 *   blank     a box with a border or a ground and nothing inside it
 *   rail      the second column, when a screen declares one, beside and not below
 *   shape     what that column is made of: the three pieces, in their order
 *
 * Every one of them is a number compared with a number, which is why this is
 * the cheap half of the visual suite: it needs no baseline image, it says
 * exactly which element is wrong, and it means the same thing on every
 * machine. The snapshots in `admin-snapshots.spec.ts` are the other half.
