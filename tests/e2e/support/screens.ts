/**
 * Every screen the dashboard has, and every tab on it.
 *
 * It lives in `support/` and not inside one spec because three suites need
 * the same list, and a list kept in three places is a list that is right in
 * one of them. The behaviour spec walks it to prove each tab answers; the
 * layout spec walks it to measure each tab; the snapshot spec walks it to
 * photograph each tab.
 *
 * A screen with a single tab draws no tab strip — `diluxone_users_tabs()`
 * returns early below two — so its slug is written down here anyway: the URL
 * takes it, and nothing on the page says what it is called. That the list is
 * complete is not left to trust either: the layout spec reads the tab strip
 * of every screen and fails if it finds a tab that is not in here, so a tab
 * added next month joins these suites the day it is added.
