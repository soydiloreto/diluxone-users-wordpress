# Extending the plugin

Everything on this page is **public API**. It does not change shape without a
major version, and the plugin's own features use these same seams — a feature
that ships inside the plugin and one that arrives from somewhere else are
built the same way.

If something you need is not here, that is the bug: say so instead of copying
a template or editing `includes/`.

## The rule

Add on top; do not reach in. Nothing in here asks you to replace a file or
copy one. If you find yourself copying a template to change a sentence or a
class, there is a seam missing.

---

## Screens and tabs

A tab is registered, not written down. Register on `diluxone_users_register_panels`,
which fires on `admin_init` — early enough for the menu and for the preview's
AJAX request, and by then every plugin has loaded, so nothing depends on which
file came first.

```php
add_action( 'diluxone_users_register_panels', function () {
    diluxone_users_register_panel(
        'diluxone-users-security',       // the screen
        'sms',                           // the tab slug, which ends up in the URL
        array(
            'label'    => __( 'By SMS', 'my-addon' ),
            'position' => 25,            // 10, 20, 30… the plugin's own leave gaps
            'render'   => 'my_addon_sms_fields',
            'save'     => 'my_addon_sms_save',   // omit for a tab with nothing to save
            'preview'  => 'my_addon_sms_preview', // optional: shown beside the fields
        )
    );
} );
```

The screen supplies the form, the nonce, the submit button and the "Saved."
notice. `render` prints the fields and nothing else.

Every screen takes panels, with no exceptions left: `diluxone-users`
(Overview), `diluxone-users-login` (Access — sign-in page, ways in,
registration), `diluxone-users-security`, `diluxone-users-social`,
`diluxone-users-account`, `diluxone-users-fields`, `diluxone-users-design`,
`diluxone-users-notices`, `diluxone-users-status` (Maintenance — status,
tools, lockout). `diluxone-users-register` and `diluxone-users-tools` are not
screens any more; their slugs redirect to the tab they became.

A tab that draws its own markup — a list with its own actions, a form with a
nonce of its own — registers with `'form' => false` and the screen stays out
of its way. That is how the field list, the provider grid and the open
sessions live beside ordinary settings tabs.

A tab exists because something registered it. Nothing registered means no tab
— not an empty one.

### The shape every screen has

The first tab of a screen with settings is a **Summary**: `form => false`,
`position => 0`, drawn with `diluxone_users_summary_table()`. It reads what
the other tabs write and edits nothing. A row is a label, a state, one line of
detail and a "Change it →" link to the tab that owns it.

There is one vocabulary of state, four words, on every screen:
`active`, `pending` (half set up, or waiting on something — always with a
reason), `off`, and `unknown` for what cannot be told from inside the site.
`diluxone_users_state_pill( $state, $why )` draws one.

A control that does not apply right now stays on the screen and keeps saving —
what is chosen applies the day the reason goes away — but it is dimmed and
`diluxone_users_not_now( $why, $url )` says why, above it, with the way out.

### Doors into an account

Registration is a set of independent doors and not one exclusive answer: the
e-mail link creates the account (`diluxone_users_login_register`), a social
account does (`diluxone_users_sso_register`), the site's own form does
(`diluxone_users_register_form` + `diluxone_users_register_page`), and
WordPress's own form does — that last one is `users_can_register`, the same
switch as Settings → General, read and written directly rather than copied.
`diluxone_users_register_mode()` still answers with one word for whatever
wants one: `login`, `form`, `both` or `closed`.

While the e-mail link is the only way in, `users_can_register` reads as off
whatever is stored (`diluxone_users_block_registration()`), and both screens
say so.

## Social login providers

`includes/sso.php` is a generic OAuth2 engine with no branch per provider:
everything comes from a table. Adding one is a filter and nothing else.

```php
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_sso_providers', function ( array $providers ): array {
    $providers['twitch'] = array(
        'name'      => 'Twitch',
        'authorize' => 'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize',
        'token'     => 'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token',
        'userinfo'  => 'https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users',
        'scope'     => 'user:read:email',
        'brand'     => '#9146FF',
    );

    return $providers;
} );
```

Its icon goes through `diluxone_users_sso_icon_paths`, and the step-by-step
for its console through `diluxone_users_sso_guides`. It then appears on the
Social login screen with its card, its redirect URL and its live test, like
any other.

## Account area sections

```php
add_action( 'diluxone_users_register_sections', function () {
    diluxone_users_register_section(
        'orders',
        array(
            'label'    => __( 'My orders', 'my-addon' ),
            'position' => 60,
            'render'   => 'my_addon_orders',        // prints the section
            'summary'  => 'my_addon_orders_card',   // optional: its card on the front page
            'available' => 'my_addon_has_shop',     // optional: hide it when there is nothing to show
        )
    );
} );
```

`summary` returns `array( 'value' => …, 'note' => …, 'cta' => … )`. A card with
an empty `value` is not drawn, but it still appears in the admin as something
that can be switched off — the list of switches does not change shape
depending on who is looking at it.

To add a card without a section of your own, filter `diluxone_users_summaries`
and give each card an `id`: that is the key the admin remembers when somebody
turns one off. Without one, the plugin makes it from the label, and the label
changes.

## Second-factor methods

```php
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_2fa_methods', function ( array $methods ): array {
    $methods['sms'] = array(
        'channel'  => 'sms',      // 'email' means "does not add anything to an e-mail link"
        'label'    => __( 'A code by SMS', 'my-addon' ),
        'help'     => __( 'We text the number on the account.', 'my-addon' ),
        'ready'    => 'my_addon_has_number',   // can this person use it?
        'send'     => 'my_addon_sms_send',
        'verify'   => 'my_addon_sms_verify',
        'position' => 30,
    );

    return $methods;
} );
```

A method registered this way appears on **Security → Two-step verification**
as one more box to tick, and it does **not** work until the site ticks it:
which methods a site offers is the site's decision, not the add-on's. The
option holding the ticked ones happens to share the filter's name — the
filter says what exists, the option says what is offered.

## Profile fields

Three seams, and you will usually want all three.

```php
// 1. The type shows up in the admin.
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_field_types', function ( array $types ): array {
    $types['signature'] = __( 'Signature', 'my-addon' );
    return $types;
} );

// 2. How it is drawn. Return '' to leave it to the plugin, which draws a text
//    box — the right answer for most of what anybody would add.
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_field_input', function ( string $html, array $field, string $value, string $id ): string {
    return 'signature' === $field['type'] ? my_addon_signature_pad( $field, $value, $id ) : $html;
}, 10, 4 );

// 3. How the value is cleaned. Return null to leave it to the plugin.
//    Whatever answers is responsible for the value being safe to store.
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_sanitize_value', function ( $clean, string $value, array $field ) {
    return 'signature' === $field['type'] ? my_addon_clean_signature( $value ) : $clean;
}, 10, 3 );
```

The markup from the second one goes through `wp_kses` with form tags and the
attributes they need: you can replace a text box, not turn it into a script
tag.

## Looks

```php
// Another shape for the sign-in page. The id becomes a class on the frame:
// .diluxone-users-login-frame--neon — bring your own CSS.
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_login_templates', function ( array $t ): array {
    $t['neon'] = array(
        'label'   => __( 'Neon', 'my-addon' ),
        'help'    => __( 'Dark, with a glow.', 'my-addon' ),
        'picture' => false,   // true gives it the picture field
    );
    return $t;
} );

// And for the account area: .diluxone-users-account--<id>
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_account_templates', function ( array $t ): array { … } );
```

Colours and corners are CSS custom properties — `--diluxone-users-accent`,
`--diluxone-users-radius` and the rest — so a site or an add-on can repoint
them from a stylesheet without any PHP at all.

### The split layout's panel

The half of the window the split shape gives to a picture can carry words
instead, or as well. They are written in **Design → The sign-in page → What
the panel says**: a mark, a heading, a paragraph, a list of what an account
gets, and the line that holds the bottom. Empty is the answer that was there
before — the picture on its own, hidden from screen readers.

The heading and the list are read a line at a time, because that is how both
are written: two deliberate lines of heading, one advantage per line. With a
picture underneath, a shade goes between the two so the words stay readable
(`--diluxone-users-login-panel-over`).

This is the seam a site was missing: before it, the only way to put a sentence
on that panel was to copy a page template, and a copied template does not
follow the plugin when the plugin changes.

## Styling it from a site

**Set a value. Do not write a selector.** This is the one rule on this page
that is about CSS, and it is here because breaking it broke a real site.

A site had written, reasonably:

```css
.diluxone-users-account--cover .diluxone-users-account__nav { gap: 36px }
```

meaning *the tab bar under the cover* — at the time, a cover implied a row of
tabs. Then the menu learnt to go down the side. The rule was still true to the
letter and no longer true to the intention: 36px of gap on a stacked menu is a
hundred pixels between items, and nobody had touched either the site or that
rule.

A property applies in every state the plugin will ever have. A selector is a
claim about which states exist, and that claim expires the next time one is
added. So the measurements are properties too, not only the colours:

| Property | What it is | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--diluxone-users-read` | The reading column, when the content is held to one | `980px` |
| `--diluxone-users-bleed` | How far the cover breaks out of the theme's column | `calc(50% - 50vw)` |
| `--diluxone-users-cover-pad` | The air inside the cover band | `40px` |
| `--diluxone-users-header-gap` | Between the picture and the name | `18px` / `24px` |
| `--diluxone-users-avatar` | The picture | `64px` / `96px` |
| `--diluxone-users-bar-bg` | Behind the menu's strip | `transparent` |
| `--diluxone-users-bar-rule` | Its rule, whole: `1px solid #ddd` | none |
| `--diluxone-users-bar-pad` | Inside the strip, above and below the menu | `10px` |
| `--diluxone-users-bar-gap` | Under the strip | `28px` |
| `--diluxone-users-bare-top` | Above the area when it has no header | `24px` |
| `--diluxone-users-nav-gap` | Between menu items | by the shape |
| `--diluxone-users-tab-pad` | Inside one | by the shape |
| `--diluxone-users-side-w` | The side menu's column | `minmax(180px, 220px)` |
| `--diluxone-users-nav-min` | Narrowest item when the menu wraps on a phone | `140px` |
| `--diluxone-users-avatar-ring` | The ring around the picture on a cover | `3px solid rgba(255,255,255,.35)` |
| `--diluxone-users-cover-at` | Where the cover picture is anchored | `center` |
| `--diluxone-users-cover-over` | What is laid over it | the cover colour at 78% |
| `--diluxone-users-sent-icon` | The circle on "check your email" | `88px` |
| `--diluxone-users-dial-w` | The dial-code column of a phone field | `minmax(0, 9rem)` |
| `--diluxone-users-border-w` | A control's edge — inputs and buttons | `1px` |
| `--diluxone-users-accent-soft` | The accent with the volume down | the accent at 12% |
| `--diluxone-users-panel-gap` | Between the rows of a panel's body | `normal` |
| `--diluxone-users-body-end` | Under the content, on a cover | `64px` |
| `--diluxone-users-body-top` | Above it | none |
| `--diluxone-users-ground` | The colour the whole account area sits on | none |
| `--diluxone-users-row-w` | The width the area's three rows line up to | from the admin |
| `--diluxone-users-row-pad` | And the gutter inside them | from the admin |
| `--diluxone-users-pad` | The gutter a cover band keeps once the breakout is off | the row gutter |
| `--diluxone-users-display-font` | The face for the headings the plugin does size — the sign-in screens it takes over | inherit |
| `--diluxone-users-login-min` | How tall a frame that took over the page is, at least | `min(720px, 80vh)` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-w` | The column the sign-in block is held to | none |
| `--diluxone-users-login-box-w` | The box the form sits in, on a split | `520px` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-box-pad` | The air inside it | `48px` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-title` | The form's heading, inside a frame | `clamp(26px, 2.4vw, 34px)` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-title-weight` | And its weight | `800` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-bg` | The split panel's colour | the accent |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-ink` | The words on it | `#fff` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-pad` | The air inside it | `56px` / `36px 20px` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-w` | The column the words are held to | `480px` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-mark` | The mark at the top of it | `42px` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-title` | Its heading | `clamp(30px, 3.4vw, 50px)` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-title-weight` | And its weight | `800` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-art` | A drawing over its colour, whole: `url(…) 0 0 / cover no-repeat` | none |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-art-opacity` | How loud that drawing is | `1` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-panel-over` | The shade between a picture and the words on it | `rgba(0,0,0,.45)` |
| `--diluxone-users-login-point-mark` | The mark before each advantage, as a mask | a tick |
| `--diluxone-users-note-bg` | Behind the note beside a drawing | transparent |
| `--diluxone-users-note-pad` | The air inside it, which turns it into a box | `0` |
| `--diluxone-users-note-gap` | Between the drawing and the words | `8px` |
| `--diluxone-users-note-mark` | The drawing's own colour | the note's |

The last two are also asked from the admin — Design → Your brand — so a site
that is not writing CSS at all still gets them. Everything on this page can be
set from a stylesheet as well; the admin is the same values with a screen in
front of them.

Two defaults in a row means the plugin's own differ by shape. Setting the
property wins in both: none of them are declared on `:root`, each is read
where it is used with the default for that place, so yours is never shadowed.
Set them wherever you like — `:root`, the page, the block:

```css
:root {
	--diluxone-users-bleed: 0px;   /* this site is already full width */
	--diluxone-users-nav-gap: 36px;
	--diluxone-users-avatar: 104px;
}
```

### The theme's colours

The plugin can take its palette from the active theme instead of having one:
Design → Your brand → "Use my theme's colours". It reads what the theme
publishes in its `theme.json`, through `wp_get_global_settings()`, and maps it
onto `--diluxone-users-accent` and the rest.

Which colour plays which part is asked and not assumed. A theme whose slugs
follow the names WordPress suggests — `base`, `contrast`, `primary`, `accent`
— is mapped without anybody being asked; a theme that numbers its colours is
not guessed at, and the screen shows the palette with a list per part.

Many themes publish variables rather than colours — Astra hands over
`var(--ast-global-color-0)`. Those are kept as they are rather than resolved,
so the plugin follows the theme live, including whatever the theme does in
dark mode.

```php
// A theme that keeps its colours somewhere of its own adds them here.
add_filter( 'diluxone_users_theme_palette', function ( array $palette ): array {
    $palette['brand'] = array( 'name' => 'Brand', 'color' => 'var(--my-brand)' );
    return $palette;
} );
```

Values are checked before they reach the stylesheet: a hex, an `rgb()/rgba()`,
an `hsl()/hsla()`, or a `var(--name)`. Anything else is dropped.

### Headings are the theme's

There is no property here for the size of a heading, and there will not be
one. The person's name is an `h1` and a section's heading is an `h2`, and the
plugin says nothing about how big they are — so they come out in the theme's
own typography and the page reads as one page.

It used to say. `font-size: 1.5em` on the name was the single thing that made
this block look pasted in: a site whose headings were a display face at 42px
got everything else on the page in it and this in one-and-a-half times the
body face. That is why the site was writing a rule — not to customise the
plugin, but to undo it.

The sign-in page is the one place this is the other way round, and the line is
worth saying out loud: **in `plain` the heading is the theme's, and inside the
three frames that take the page over it is the plugin's.** A designed screen,
edge to edge, with a theme's `h2` dropped into it reads as a form that landed
in a blog post; a form the theme placed itself should look like everything
else the theme places, and does. Those sizes are properties —
`--diluxone-users-login-title`, `--diluxone-users-login-panel-title` — so a
site with a scale of its own still says it once, as a value.

What the plugin does keep is the layout of its own header: the margins around
the name, the gap beside the picture, the air at the end of a cover. Those are
this block's, not the theme's.

### The one thing that is not a property

Where the area's three rows — the header's contents, the menu across the top,
the body — line up with the rest of the page. That is asked from Design →
Account area instead, and the rule is printed only when it has been answered.

It was a property for a day and it was wrong, in a way worth writing down.
The rule read `padding-inline: var(--diluxone-users-pad, 0px)`, and the
neutral default is not neutral: this sheet loads after the site's, so `0` won,
and a site that had been lining those rows up with its own grid lost the
alignment without anybody touching it. **A value that means "nothing" still
beats a value that means something.** The only declaration that cannot
overrule anybody is the one that is not printed.

So where the plugin has no opinion, it prints no rule — and where a site
wants one, it answers the question and the plugin prints exactly that.

What it prints is the number as the **fallback of a property**, not as the
value: `padding-inline: var(--diluxone-users-row-pad, 24px)`. The rule still
exists only because somebody answered — that is the part that mattered — and
the answer stays something a stylesheet can move, which is what a gutter that
is 24px on a wide screen and 20px on a phone needs. A screen of numbers cannot
ask a media query. The same goes for the width, for the air above and below
the content, and for the colour the area sits on.

When you do need a selector — your own typeface on the name, your own colour
on the open item — **style what the thing is, not what a template implies it
is**. Every axis is a class on the element it describes, so there is always
one that means exactly what you mean:

| Axis | Classes | On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which shape | `--plain` `--cover` | the area |
| Where the menu goes | `--tabs` `--side` | the area |
| How wide | `--contained` `--full` | the area |
| Which way the menu runs | `--row` `--column` | the menu |
| What the menu looks like | `--pills` `--underline` `--plain` | the menu |

`.diluxone-users-account__nav--row` is a row of items, in every template there
will ever be. `.diluxone-users-account--cover .diluxone-users-account__nav`
was a row of items *until Tuesday*.

## Templates

`diluxone_users_template` filters the path of any template before it is
loaded. A theme does not need it: dropping a file in
`wp-content/themes/<theme>/diluxone-users/` is enough, and the list of files
is on the Status screen.

## Options

`diluxone_users_option` filters any setting as it is read. A site that pins
one from code gets it pinned for good — and the admin says so, with the
function and file doing the pinning, rather than showing a control that does
nothing.

## Things that happen

- `diluxone_users_logged_in` — somebody got in. Receives the user and how.
- `diluxone_users_fields_saved` — a person's fields were saved.
- `diluxone_users_register_sections`, `diluxone_users_register_panels` — the
  moments to register.

## What the plugin will not promise

Anything not on this page. Function names, file layout and markup can change
between versions; these seams cannot.
