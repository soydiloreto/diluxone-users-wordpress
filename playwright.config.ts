 * End-to-end tests against the wp-env DEV site (port 8892).

 * The dev site mounts the repo root, so what runs here is the working tree,
 * not the built dist — and tests/e2e/mu-plugin/diluxone-e2e.php is mapped into
 * mu-plugins from .wp-env.json, which is what lets a test read the site's mail
 * and answer as a social network.
 *
 * Almost every spec is somebody who is NOT signed in: that is what signing in
 * means. So there is no shared storage state; the specs that need the
 * dashboard say so themselves with `test.use({ storageState: ADMIN_STATE })`.
 *
 * Override WP_BASE_URL / WP_USER / WP_PASS to point the suite elsewhere.

 * runner to match them is asking for a job that is red for reasons nobody can
 * act on, and a gate nobody can act on is a gate that gets switched off. So
 * the picture suite is a project that only exists when it is asked for —
 * `make test-visual`, on the machine whose pictures these are — while the
 * measurements in `admin-layout.spec.ts` mean the same thing everywhere and
 * run with everything else.
